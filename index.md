It will use your computers camera to use OpenCV and you will need an object (Right now the object should be green) to begin drawing on the screen. The program has the capabilities of changing the color of your cursor and have and eraser to delete and miss guided/undintended strokes. You'll will have the function to save your creation afterwards!
